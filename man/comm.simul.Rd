Flexible framework of individual-based simulation of community assembly
following framework proposed by Botta-Dukat & Czucz (2016), but allowing
intraspecific trait variation (ITV)
}
\details{
This function is a framework for simulation of assembly in a meta-community.
The simulation consists of a community initialization followed by an
iterative simulation of a "disturbanceâ€“regeneration" cycle.
During initialization a species pool is created defining each species by
its trait values. Each locality is characterized by an environmental variable.
Initial composition of local communities is a random selection from the species
pool: species identity is selected independently for each individal with
probability of seedling survival (that depends on local environment and trait value).


The "disturbance-regeneration" cycle consists of the following steps:
\enumerate{
      \item disturbance event: some randomly selected individuals
            die in each community
      \item survivors produce seeds. Seed production depends on fertility
            of the locality and competition among coexisting individuals
      \item seeds are dispersed among localities
      \item all seeds germinate and seedlings struggle for survival. The number of
            adults in local communities is fixed, thus number of seedlings that can
            survive and grow up equals to the number of individulas died in the
            disturbance event (in the recent version one individual dies, but planed development
            is introducing a disturbance severity/number of deaths parameter)
}


It is a flexible framework that calls funcions for:

\itemize{
   \item generating species pool
         (\code{\link{Gener.species.pool}})
   \item calculating pairwise competition coefficients
         (\code{\link{competition.kernel}})
   \item calculating seedling's survival probabilities
         (\code{\link{tolerance}})
   \item calculating number of produced seeds
         (\code{\link{SeedProduction}})
   \item calculating trait values of offsprings
         (\code{\link{fITV}})
   \item seed dispersal among localities
         (\code{\link{fDispersal}})
        }
Functions available in the package can be easily replaced by user-defined
functions.
