	abstract = {1. There is a limit to the similarity (and hence to the number) of competing species which can coexist. The total number of species is proportional to the total range of the environment divided by the niche breadth of the species. The number is reduced by unequal abundance of resources but increased by adding to the dimensionality of the niche. Niche breadth is increased with increased environmental uncertainty and with decreased productivity. 2. There is a different evolutionary limit, L, to the similarity of two coexisting species such that a) If two species are more similar than L, a third intermediate species will converge toward the nearer of the pair. b) If two species are more different than L, a third intermediate species will diverge from either toward a phenotype intermediate between the two.},

	abstract = {I investigate the evolution of a continuous trait, such as body size or arms level, which affects the outcome of competitive contests such that the contestant with the larger trait value has a higher probability of winning. I show that a polymorphism of distinctly different strategies can evolve in an initially monomorphic population even if mutations have only small phenotypic effect. In a simple Lotka–Volterra-type model of asymmetric competition, I derive the conditions under which two strategies can gradually evolve from a single ancestral strategy; the evolution of higher level polymorphisms is studied by numerical analysis and computer simulations of specific examples. High levels of polymorphism may build up during evolution. The coevolution of strategies in polymorphic populations, however, may also lead to extinction, which decreases the level of polymorphism. I discuss whether the evolution of several haploid strategies from a single initial strategy may correspond to the evolution of several sympatric species in a diploid outbreeding population.},

	abstract = {Trade-offs in performance of different ecological functions within a species are commonly offered as an explanation for co-existence in natural communities. Single trade-offs between competitive ability and other life history traits have been shown to support a large number of species, as a result of strong competitive asymmetry. We consider a single competition-fecundity trade-off in a homogeneous environment, and examine the effect of the form of asymmetry on the likelihood of species co-existing. We find conditions that allow co-existence of two species for a general competition function, and show that (1) two species can only co-exist if the competition function is sufficiently steep when the species are similar; (2) when competition is determined by a linear function, no more than two species can co-exist; (3) when the competition between two individuals is determined by a discontinuous step function, this single trade-off can support an arbitrarily large number of species. Further, we show analytically that as the degree of asymmetry in competition increases, the probability of a given number of species co-existing also increases, but note that even in the most favourable conditions, large numbers of species co-existing along a single trade-off is highly unlikely. On this basis, we suggest it is unlikely that single trade-offs are able to support high levels of bio-diversity without interacting other processes.},
